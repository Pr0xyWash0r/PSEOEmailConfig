This script is a very rough first, working, attempt at trying to automate a majority of process that was previously very hands on in our enviroment.
It is sloppy, poorly over documented, and could be made massivley more streamlined; but it works, and is great jumping point for more Exchange Online controll through powershell. 

The storing of credentials in the first section of the script refers to an ecrypted text file generated by the 'password.ps1' file.

There are few points in the script that must be manually set by whoever is running it.
These are documented near the top, I suggest just searching for anything with '<'.

Script not created by me is included starting at line 124, the original creator is Dave Thijssen, I highly recomend looking  at his blog for more great content and ideas.
A more in-depth version of the Singature.html file can be found at his blog at this address http://www.davethijssen.nl/2014/05/set-uniform-individual-outlook-web-app.html.
